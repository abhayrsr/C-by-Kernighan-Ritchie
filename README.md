# C-by-Kernighan-Ritchie
Learning and practicing C programming through exercises and projects from The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

# C Programming Practice

Welcome to my **C Programming Practice** repository! This repo contains all the code and exercises I'm working on while learning **C** from the classic book *The C Programming Language* by **Brian Kernighan** and **Dennis Ritchie**.

## About

In this repository, you will find my implementations of various C programs, exercises, and practice problems. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, solidify my understanding of C, and share my learning journey.

The programs are written, tested, and executed using **Neovim** and the **GCC** compiler on a Linux-based environment.

## Structure

Each file or directory in this repo will contain:

- **Programs** based on concepts introduced in the book.
- **Exercise solutions** from the book, labeled by chapter and exercise number.
- **Projects** or small programs created for practice.

## Tools & Setup

- **Editor**: Neovim
- **Compiler**: GCC
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu)

## How to Run

To compile and run a C program from this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C.git
   cd C ```

2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name ```

## Goals

- Master the C programming language and its core concepts.
- Practice exercises from The C Programming Language book.
- Develop a deeper understanding of algorithms, data structures, and systems programming.
